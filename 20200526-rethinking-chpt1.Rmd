## Installation of `rstan` on a Windows 10 machine

Below is a breakdown of steps needed to install the `rethinking` package with a freshly `R` and `RStudio` installation, starting from installing the dependencies. Codes are included below the step list.

1. install `Rtools`: download `Rtools` from and follow the instruction on the [CRAN "Using Rtools40 on Windows" page](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), take notice to check if the version of `RTools` is compatible with *your* `R` version. Also, to "restart R" as instructed, assuming you are using `RStudio`, you would need to quit and reopen the RStudio, and only restarting the R session within RStudio would not update the path. 

2. install `devtools` if needed, you can check by running `find.package('devtools')`. If the package is not found (e.g. output `Error in find.package('devtools') : there is no package called ‘devtools’`), install by running `install.packages('devtools)`.

3. load `devtools` and verify `Rtools` installation by running `find_rtools()`. This step is ordered as such because the function `find_rtools()` is in the `devtools` package.

4. install `RStan` by running `install.packages("rstan", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/", dependencies = TRUE)`. This actually installs `RStan` from source, which is the reason for all previous steps needed in Windows.

5. install `rethinking` from source (GitHub) by running `devtools::install_github('rmcelreath/rethinking')`

```{r eval = FALSE}
# step 1
# download and install RTools40 from CRAN Rtools website, not shown
# put the location of the Rtools make utilities (bash, make, etc) on the PATH
# there are multiple ways to do it, one way is to run the next line in R
writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = '~/.Renviron')
# restart R - restart the whole RStudio if in one, then verify the path
Sys.which('make')
## "C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe"

# step 2
find.package('devtools')
## Error in find.package('devtools') : there is no package called ‘devtools’
if(!require('devtools')){
    install.packages('devtools', dependencies = TRUE)
}
## 20200526, Win10, the package `backports` needed to be explicitly installed 
## for `devtools` to be correctly loaded
## I suspect that is a compatibility issue in `backports` with R 4.0
## when prompted to choose whether to install from source instead of binary, 
## confirm to use the source (the source is of later versioni than the binary)
# install.packages('backports')

# step 3
library('devtools')
find_rtools()

# step 4
install.packages('rstan', 
                 repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', dependencies = TRUE)
library('rstan')

# step 5
devtools::install_github('rmcelreath/rethinking')
library(rethinking)
help(package=rethinking)
## verify successful installation if in-system help opens up
```

## Linear regression with two independent categorical variables - an example with `stats::lm()`, `brms`, and `rethinking`

Consider a linear regression model in the form of: 

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1,i} + \beta_2 x_{2,i} + \beta_3 x_{1,i} x_{2,i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

### Data simulation

What information we need for each sample as a starting point is:

1. "treated/untreated" by drug A: as a integer, in this case binary (0 or 1) 
2. "treated/untreated" by drug B: as a integer, in this case binary (0 or 1) 
3. "measurement of treatment effects": as a float, in this case randomly generated

``` {r}
set.seed(13)
drugA <- c(rep(0, 10), rep(1, 10))
drugB <- rep(c(rep(0, 5), rep(1, 5)), 2)
effect <- c(rnorm(5), rnorm(5) + 2, rnorm(5) + 3, rnorm(5) + 10)
alldat <- data.frame(
    'drugA' = drugA, 'drugB' = drugB, 'effect' = effect
)
print(alldat)
```

### Linear regression with two independent categorical variables - with `stats::lm()`

```{r}
twovarMod <- lm(effect ~ drugA + drugB + drugA:drugB, data = alldat)
print(summary(twovarMod))
```

### Linear regression with two independent categorical variables - with `brms`

Fitting a Bayesian Generalized Linear Multivariate Model:

(Expect a large chunk of output as the BRMS fit finishes up.)

```{r}
library('brms')
alldatFactor <- data.frame(
    'drugA' = factor(drugA, levels = c(0, 1)), 'drugB' = factor(drugB, levels = c(0, 1)), 'effect' = effect
)
brmCatMod <- brm(effect ~ drugA + drugB + drugA:drugB, data = alldatFactor)
```

As an interesting side note: it took me a good while for the BRMS fitting run to get pass compiling the C++ model. (There is always a balance between the result performance and the speed.)

```{r}
print(summary(brmMod))
```

```{r}
conditional_effects(brmCatMod, effects = 'drugA:drugB')
# to see all effects (both individual and two-ways)
# remove the argument effects from the command above
```

`R` is always interesting when it comes to factors. What if we don't

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
brmMod <- brm(effect ~ drugA + drugB + drugA:drugB, data = alldat, silent = TRUE)
conditional_effects(brmMod)
```

### Linear regression with two independent categorical variables - with `rethinking`

### Side-by-side comparison of the fittings

```{r}
# prepare for side-by-side comparison
print(twovarMod$coefficients)
print(fixef(brmCatMod))
```

## Supplementary information

### Installation of package `brms`

The package `brms` is available on CRAN. Install by running `install.packages('brms')` and verify the installation by running `library('brms')`. 

## For future references

### The session info when the documentation is written

The current version is written on 20200526, with a recent `R 4.0` release.

Before starting the installation process, out of personal maintenance preferences, I removed `R` (then version 3.6), RStudio, and `Rtools` and installed the latest versions of `R` (now version 4.0) and RStudio (now version 1.3.959). For `Rtools`, notice the version compatibility with `R 4.0`. `Rtools40` installation is described above.

As a reference point for the environment-specific fixes above, I am recording my 20200526 session information for the "this works on my machine" setting, to be compared to *your* session information if needed.

### Do-dos:

1. [ ] add resource links
2. [ ] add support to other operation systems
3. [ ] add repo-level "getting started with R and RStudio" and "Some struggles with Windows and how to solve hopefully under 5 hours"
4. [ ] double check encoding and line breaks since this is written on my Win10 machine
5. [ ] add "slides" for chapter 1 (and organize: as a separate file?)
6. [ ] add pointers to lab meeting slides on regression (20200518) and BRMS (20190722)
7. [ ] add model selection examples in BRMS?
