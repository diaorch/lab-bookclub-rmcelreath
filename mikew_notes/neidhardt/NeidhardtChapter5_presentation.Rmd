## How do bacteria create themselves from components in the medium?

- Several hundred enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Can be subdivided into:
    - **Biosynthetic Pathways** - from 12 precursor metabolites to building blocks
    - **Fueling Pathways** - from ingredients of the medium to metabolic needs
    
## The 12 precursor metabolites

    mutate(building_block = fct_reorder(building_block, `umol/g`, max)) %>%
    mutate(class = fct_reorder(class, -`umol/g`, min)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = building_block, x = `umol/g`, fill = class)) + 
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
    geom_col() + theme_bw() + labs(y = "", x = "umol/g", fill = "Class")
```

## Table 2 - Basic building block requirements
```{r}
pathways <- tibble(precursor = 
c("acCoA", "eryP","fruP","gluP","akg","oaa","penP", "pep","pga","pyr","triosP"),
pathway = c("Linker", "Pentose", "EMP", "EMP", "TCA", "TCA", "Pentose", "EMP", "EMP", "EMP", "EMP"))
```

                 values_to = "precursor_count", names_to = "precursor") %>%

    ggplot(aes(x = sum, y = precursor, fill = pathway)) + geom_col() +
    theme_bw() + labs(x = "Total umol/g precursor", y = "", fill = "Pathway")
```

```

## Assimilation of Nitrogen - organic sources
- None of the 12 precursor metabolites contain nitrogen or sulfur
- Most organic sources have N in the -3 oxidation state
    - Amino groups
    - Imino groups
    - heterocyclic nitrogen atoms
- These get metabolized by bacteria into $NH_4^+$
- Enzymes that catalyze pathways leading to $NH_4^+$ are usually genetically controlled
    - They are off when plenty of $NH_4^+$ is around

## Assimilation of Nitrogen - inorganic sources
- Most significant inorganic sources are:
    - $NH_4^+$
    - $NO_3^-$ (*E. coli* only anaerobically)
    - $N_2$ (*E. coli* cannot use this)
- Utilization of $NO_3^-$ uses two reactions
    - $NO_3^- \rightarrow NO_2^-$ by Assimilatory Nitr**a**te Reductase
    - $NO_2^- \rightarrow NH_4^+$ by Assimilatory Nitr**i**te Reductase
- $NO_3^-$ can also be used as the terminal electron acceptor in respiration
    - Anaerobic respiration
    - *E. coli* can do this
- Nitrogen fixation ($N_2 \rightarrow NH_4^+$)
    - Nitrogenase - combination of two iron-sulfur proteins
    - Azoferredoxin
    - Molybdoferredoxin (has two molybdenum atoms as well)

## Assimilation of Nitrogen - $NH_4^+ \rightarrow$ organic compounds
- Large diversity in obtaining $NH_4^+$ but only two ways to utilize it
- Directly into glutamate by L-Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH)
- Indirectly by a cycle of reactions (GS-GOGAT)
    - Glutamine synthetase (GS)
    - Glutamate Synthase (glutamate-$\alpha$-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, GOGAT)
- Reaction is basically the same though ($\alpha$-ketoglutarate + $NH_4^+ \rightarrow$ glutamate)
- Major differences between GDH and GS
    - GS has higher affinity for ammonia than GDH
    - GS-catalyzed reaction needs ATP whereas GDH doesn't
- Organisms that have both (like *E. coli*) can balance energy with nitrogen needs
    - GS is turned off if ammonia is high
    - GS is also inhibited by eight compounds derived from glutamine
    - GS is also post-translationally modified by adenylation (on/off controlled by one enzyme)
        - Controlled by ratio of glutamine to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate

## Assimilation of Sulfur - $H_2S \rightarrow$ cysteine
- Major reaction is O-acetylserine sulfohydrolase
    - $H_2S$ + O-acetylserine + $\rightarrow$ cysteine + acetate + water
- Any other source of sulfur must be converted to $H_2S$ to be used
- $H_2S$ is only really in anaerobic environments
- Sulfate is the most common source in the lab (probably not in environment though)
- Bulk of S probably comes in through C-bonded S in organic compounds
- Enzymes that can use sulfates are turned on by organic sulfates

## Assimilation of Phosphorus - phosphate $\rightarrow$ ATP
- Differs from nitrogen and sulfur in two key aspects
    - Is not oxidized or reduced
    - Assimilated through fueling pathways instead of biosynthesis
- Organic phosphate compounds don't usually penetrate the cell membrane
- Hydrolysis of organic phosphates is driven by akaline phosphatase in the periplasm
- Akaline phosphatase is repressed when phosphate is in the medium
- *E. coli* also has a 5$'$ nucleotidase that acts in the periplasm
- Free phosphate is taken up into ATP

## Nutritional diversity - How specialized is a bug?
- Bacteria can take advantage of preformed building blocks
- **Auxotrophs** lack one or more biosynthetic pathways
- **Prototrophs** are "complete biochemists" (like *E. coli*)
- Reciprocal relationship between biosynthetic capability and nutritional requirements
- Those with rich growth environments tend to do away with unnecessary pathways

- Medium has
    - glucose and inorganic salts
    - 21 amino acids, ribonucleosides, deoxyribonucleosides
    - glycerol phosphate, fatty acids, ornithine, glucosamine, ethanolamine, heptose, KDO
- 85% of the energy and 100% of reducing power is saved by harvesting from media
- These costs swing even more wildly depending on carbon source

## Fueling reactions - where bacteria show their diversity
- Biosynthesis is basically the same in all bacteria
- Goal is to create the 12 precursor metabolites/energy
- These reactions are typically called central metabolism

- Malate: net energy needed, Glucose: net energy produced
- Need 42,703 $\mu$mol of ~P
    - 24,218 for polymerization (Chapter 4)
    - 18,485 for biosynthesis (Chapter 5)

## Fermentation vs. Respiration - what do I do with all these reduced pyridine nucleotides?
- **Fermentation** - reoxidation through reducing organic metabolites
- **Respiration** - reoxidation through electron transport
    - Does **not** neccesarily need oxygen (anaerobic respiration)
- Oxygen does play into what pathways are used by a cell
    - **Strict Aerobes** - only grow in oxygen
    - **Anaerobes** - only grow without oxygen
    - **Faculative Anaerobes** - can grow in +/- oxygen
    - **Indifferent Anaerobes** - make ATP by fermentation regardless of oxygen

## *E. coli* - Electron transport chain

![](NeidhardtChapter5_figures/etc.png)

- Major energy production with $O_2$ as the acceptor

## Electron transport chain in other bacteria
- **Chemolithotrophs** - generate ATP but uncoupled from NAD reduction
- Use reverse electron transport to reduce NAD
- Hydrogen bacteria couple substrate oxidation directly to reduction of NAD

![](NeidhardtChapter5_figures/etc_acceptors.png)

## Utilization of oxygen - what is needed?
- A lack of enzymes that are intrinisically sensitive to oxygen
- The ability to break down hydrogen peroxide ($H_2O_2$) and superoxide($O\cdot_2^-$)
- Some aerobes have enzymes that are sensitive to $O_2$
    - *Azotobacter* respires fast enough to protect its nitrogenase
    - Cyanobacteria have heterocysts to contain nitrogenase in an anaerobic pocket
- Catalase - $2H_2O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O + O_2$
- Superoxide dismutase - $2O\cdot_2^- + 2H^+ \rightarrow O_2 + H_2O_2$

## Fermentation - making ATP and oxidizing NADH $\rightarrow$ NAD+

![](NeidhardtChapter5_figures/homolactic_fermentation.png)

- ATP made through substrate-level phosphrylation
- Strict redox balance is maintained
- Since you need both oxidation and reduction subtrates are usually intermediate
in redox (i.e. sugars)
- Since energy yield is low you need alot of substrate. Carbon can be harvested
from fermentation end products
- Pyruvate usually involved but end products are different

## Fermentation - the diversity of end products

## Phototrophs and their fueling reactions
- **Oxygenic** photosynthesis - cyanobacteria and blue-green bacteria
- **Anoxygenic** photosynthesis - purple bacteria, purple-sulfur, green bacteria
-  Cyclic photophosphorylation - basically ETC but using light as the energy source
    - Chlorophyll is the electron donor and acceptor
    - Membrane-bound so have increased cytoplasmic membrane
- Photosynthetic aparatus
    - light-harvesting antenna
    - reaction center
    - ETC
    
## Sources of reducing power in phototrophs

![](NeidhardtChapter5_figures/photosynthesis.png){ height=60% }

- Since NADH/NADPH is not used, phototrophs reduce NADP in different ways
    - Purple nonsulfur use organic compounds or $H_2$
    - Purple sulfur and green use reduced sulfur
    - oxygenic cyanobacteria use water and produce $O_2$

## Phototrophs - Formation of precursors
- Synthesize precursors through $CO_2$
- Green bacteria fix $CO_2$ by reversing the TCA cycle
- Other phototrophs fix $CO_2$ by the Calvin-Benson pathway
    - Uses ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase (may be most abundant enzyme on earth)
    - Utilizes ATP and reduced NADP rather than generating them
- Fueling is done through photosynthesis
- Fueling for chemolithotrophs is done through aerobic respiration of inorganic
substrate
