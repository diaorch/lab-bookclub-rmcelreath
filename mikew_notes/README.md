# Notes on McElreath's 2nd edition of Statistical Rethinking

These are my personal notes on McElreath's 2nd edition of statistical rethinking.
I am following along using Solomon Kurz's adaptation converting the code into
`tidyverse` like syntax. I try to use exact quotes from the book or from Solomon
and many, if not all, of the code examples are directly from Solomon in his book
with my additional comments to clarify the code. You can find his book here:

https://bookdown.org/content/3890/

However, I also originally went through the first edition of Statistical
Rethinking also following Solomon Kurz's example here:

https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/

I sometimes will pull examples from that edition as well where appropriate. 
Some of my paraphrasing of each of the points in these books will not have 
direct quotes.

For each chapter you can find a compiled version of the notes under
`chapter*.md` which should be readily viewable directly in the
browser. To see the source code used to compile these `.md files`
checkout the `chapter*.Rmd` file which was subsequently knitted into
the github-flavored markdown.

Here I will place the source files needed to create my presentations for my
assigned chapters in Neidhardt. I am using Rmarkdown to compile
a beamer presentation using LaTeX and pandoc.
